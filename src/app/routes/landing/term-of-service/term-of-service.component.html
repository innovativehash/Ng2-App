(“us”, “we”, or “our”). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

  <h2>COMMUNICATIONS</h2>

  <p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>

  <h2>PURCHASES</h2>

  <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete. The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>


  <h2>SUBSCRIPTION TERM AND PAYMENT</h2>

  <p>Your Service is provided on a subscription basis for a set term that is specified on your invoice. Unless otherwise noted on your Order Form, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term. Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscriptions from automatically renewing. If you elect to cancel, your Service will terminate at the end of the applicable subscription term and you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.</p>

  <p>You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed fees for the Service as set forth on the invoice. Any and all payments you make to us for the Service are final and non-refundable.  If we agree to accept your payment via invoice rather than by credit card, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date.</p>

  <p>We will provide you with notice of non-payment of any amount due. Unless the full amount has been paid, we may suspend your access to your Service thirty (30) days after such notice. We will not suspend your Service while you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If your Service is suspended for non-payment, we may charge a re-activation fee to reinstate your service.</p>
